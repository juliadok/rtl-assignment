# Front-end Software Engineer Development Test

The goal of this test is to assert your coding and architectural skills.
You are given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing development techniques.

This test should be written in React and should consume the json that we are sending with it

## Task

Given the json response from a bundle page render using React the list of articles in a way that you think is good for the users to consume it (bundle is a page which show a list of articles/videos/columns on RTL MSP Platform, for example: https://www.rtlboulevard.nl/entertainment/showbizz/bundel/4532761/de-uitschieters-van-2018).

You don't have to build the article, video pages. Only the list of articles and link to our site using the url provided in the json response.

### Requirements

- Render the title, description, label and list of items (title, label, image)
- Build in React
- Add unit tests

### Bonus points

- Use Typescript
- Add end-to-end tests

Remember: There is no right or wrong way to do the test. Main goal is to asses the choices made and the skills used.

## Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Get Started

If you want to see the result, follow the [link](https://juliadok.github.io/rtl-assignment/).

To run the project locally, please do the following:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Launches the end-to-end test runner.<br />
If you are running end-to-end tests locally, please make sure the application is running using `npm start` command.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
